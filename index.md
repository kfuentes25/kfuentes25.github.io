### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    Part 2 was really fun because I really like all types of games and we created a HiLo game where the user guesses a number from 1 to 10. Me and my partner for this lab used control structures to tell the user if their guess was correct, too high, or too low. Additionally we made it so that the user gets a second guess if their first guess is incorrect using more control structures.
*Lab 8
    Part 2 was one of my favorites because I’ve always wondered how some video games like Call of Duty found averages in K/D/A ratio. We wrote functions that took in line arguments and averaged. It made me see that the games could possibly keep track of all your statistics and continues to average them out.
*Lab 9
    Part 1 was cool because I didn’t know how olympic judges determined their scores as they remove the largest score and the lowest score so that bias is somewhat removed from the judging. I had some trouble with this one because I couldn’t figure how to make the average but made a separate function for the removal of both the highest and lowest scores and then used the function to get the score.
